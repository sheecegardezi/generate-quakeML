# 1. Introduction
Quakeml Generator uses the Obspy framework to create, fill and write a new event to a quakeml file.  Data to be written to a quakeml file is passed to the program as a .txt file. Instructions and examples for formatting the .txt file for proper parsing are described below.  This program is written for quakeml version 1.2 documentation may be found here: [https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml/Documents]

# 2. Install
  Clone remote repository 
  > git clone git@github.com:sheecegardezi/generate-quakeML.git
  >   
  > cd generate-quakeML
  > 
  > python3 -m venv venv

  Activate python virtual environment
  On variants of Linux run:
  > 
  > source venv/bin/activate
  
  On Windows machine run:
  > venv/Scripts/activate
  
  Install python dependencies   
  > python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run Instructions
  Execute from command line followed by input file
  > python -m  generate-quakeml  input.txt -o output.xml
  
  For help
  > python -m  generate-quakeml -h 

#4. Run tests
  Execute testing framework
  > python -m unittest

# 4. Files Description
- genquake - main python executable (from command line with filein as arg)
- utils.py - header file contains functions to generate quakeml 
- TextAsInput.py - functions to handle filein as arg, and parse text file in. 
- input.txt - example input file
- output.txt - example output file


# 5. Input File Instructions

1. Must be a text file ending in .txt
2. Must contain all keys from example file (eventid, datasourceâ€¦etc)
3. Keys and values are separated by triple colon, ex. ::: 
4. Values may be left blank, but keys and separators are required
- uncertainty:::7     // ok
- uncertainty:::      // ok, will create empty node    
- uncertainty         // wrong, no separator
- newkey:::value      // wrong, only predefined keys are accepted in this version
5) One entry per line

## 5.1 Format Example:  
eventid:::us1000ex1     <br>
datasource:::US         <br>
eventsource:::US        <br>
mag:::0.1               <br>
type:::Mw               <br>
